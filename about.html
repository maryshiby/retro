    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1888 by George Eastman, the Eastman Kodak Brownie Camera Company revolutionized photography, bringing it to the masses. The original Brownie camera, introduced in 1900, was a breakthrough in simplicity and affordability, making photography accessible to people from all walks of life.</p>

    <p>Throughout the years, we've remained dedicated to capturing moments, memories, and history. Our cameras have documented countless life events, from family gatherings to historic moments that shaped the world.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At the Eastman Kodak Brownie Camera, our mission is to celebrate the art of photography and preserve the spirit of the past. We believe that every photograph tells a story, and our cameras have been instruments of storytelling for generations.</p>

    <p>We continue to honor the legacy of the Brownie camera by embracing its simplicity and focusing on the essence of photography: capturing a moment in time. Join us on a journey through history as we blend the charm of the past with the technology of the present.</p>
